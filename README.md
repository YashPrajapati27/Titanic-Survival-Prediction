# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning. The primary algorithm used is Linear Regression, and several Python libraries, including NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn (sklearn), are utilized for data processing, visualization, and model building.

## Introduction
The Titanic Survival Prediction project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features like age, sex, class, etc. This is a classic machine learning problem often used for educational purposes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle. It contains information about the passengers, such as their age, sex, class, fare, and whether they survived or not.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
